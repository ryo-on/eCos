2007-11-12  Oyvind Harboe  <oyvind.harboe@zylin.com>

	* doc/athttpd.cdl: Fixed typos in doc. Return value from handler is not 
	used, recommend returning 0 in doc.

2006-12-03  Anthony Tonizzo  <atonizzo@gmail.com>

	* cdl/httpd.cdl: Corrected a CDL error in the requirements of
	CYGOPT_NET_ATHTTPD_USE_FS

2006-11-27  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/httpd.cdl: Improve CDL dependencies.

2006-11-08  Anthony Tonizzo  <atonizzo@gmail.com>

	* doc/athttpd.sgml: Updated to describe lasted changes and corrected
	minor typos.
	* src/http.c: Check for "Content-Type" header. This is needed if we
	want to support parsing form variables in POST requests.
	* src/jim.c: Updated with latest release from Jim CVS.
	* src/cgi.c: streamlined cyg_httpd_exec_cgi_tcl(), now uses the 'source'
	command of tcl to execute a tcl script.
	* src/forms.c: Modified cyg_handle_method_POST so that the variables in the
	payload are scanned only if the request has a Content-Type 
	of 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
	* src/jim-aio.c: Added to package. Now tcl has IO functions to access a
	file system.
	* include/httpd.h: Added a new mode, CYG_HTTPD_MODE_FORM_DATA which is set
	when a POST request has a Content-Type of 
	'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
	    
2006-10-16  Lars Povlsen  <lpovlsen@vitesse.com> and Anthony Tonizzo  <atonizzo@gmail.com>

	* cdl/httpd.cdl: add CYGOPT_NET_ATHTTPD_CLOSE_CHUNKED_CONNECTIONS. Default
	is set to CLOSE, so it is backward compatible with 
	previous versions of the browser.
	* src/socket.c: cyg_httpd_process_request() uses a loop to collect at least
	one full frame (til a header terminator is found), 
	cyg_httpd_start_chunked() only close if configured to do so.
	* src/httpd.c: Overhaul of cyg_httpd_send_error to avoid the use of
	inbuffer as temporary storage (conflicts with pipelined frames),
	removed the option to send a page after calling a C language
	handler
	* include/httpd.h: Added a new mode, CYG_HTTPD_MODE_NO_CACHE
	    
2006-10-12  Lars Povlsen  <lpovlsen@vitesse.com> and Anthony Tonizzo  <atonizzo@gmail.com>

	* cdl/httpd.cdl: add CYGNUM_ATHTTPD_SERVER_MAX_POST to limit POST'ed data
	* include/http.h: Added header_end, post_data fields to httpstate,
	Added "302 Found" for POST handler redirect (CYG_HTTPD_STATUS_MOVED_TEMPORARILY)
	* src/forms.c: Fixed variable decoding, fixed large POST processing
	* src/http.c: Fixed some debug ouptuts, cleanup after POST processing, 
	overhaul of the pipelined requests code which can now
	handle multiple requests per frame.
	* src/socket.c: Removed assert for socket write failure, Accumulating receiving
	of requests (Browsers (Firefox) may pass partial headers in separate 
	fragments). Fixed some diagnostics output.

2006-07-19  Anthony Tonizzo  <atonizzo@gmail.com> and Sergei Gavrikov  <w3sg@softhome.net>

	* cdl/httpd.cdl: 
	* doc/athttpd.sgml: Corrected some typos and rectified some omissions.
	* include/jim.h:    Added an inline to Jim_InitExtension()
	* src/cgi.c:        used malloc() instead of cyg_ldr_malloc();
	* src/forms.c:      Added a #define to be able tio use the TCL scripting
	without OBJLOADER
	* src/http.c:       
	* src/socket.c:     Lots of typos stamped out, and some better comments too.
	                     
2006-07-19  Anthony Tonizzo  <atonizzo@gmail.com>

	* src/socket.c: Corrected a typo that generated an assertion.
	Modified slightly the source of cyg_httpd_write and cyg_httpd_writev
	to make the code more consistent as to when assertions are thrown.

2006-07-19  Sergei Gavrikov  <w3sg@softhome.net>

	* doc/athttpd.sgml: jade doesn't allow underscores in
	id attributes, so fix.

2006-07-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/httpd.cdl: Add -D __ECOS in compiler flags.
	Change include_dir to cyg/athttpd.
	Rename all CDL options from *_HTTPD_* to *_ATHTTPD_*.
	* All files: Rename cyg/httpd include directory to cyg/athttpd.
	Rename all CDL options from *_HTTPD_* to *_ATHTTPD_*.
	* doc/athttpd.sgml: Document MD5 algorithm licensing.
	* src/socket.c: Remove unused SNTP include.
